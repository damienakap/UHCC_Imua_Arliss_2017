
Feather M0 Adalogger setup:

	In the Arduino IDE window:
	
	1) File > Preferences
	2) add "https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json"
		to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs:" field.
	3) Click ok.
	
	4) Tools > Board > Board Manager
	5) Install "Adafruit SAMD Boards"
	6) Tools > Board > Adafruit Feather M0
	
	In your code:
		1) You may need to add the following lines just above the first function 
		in order to use Serial:
		
			#if defined(ARDUINO_SAMD_ZERO) && defined(SERIAL_PORT_USBVIRTUAL)
			  // Required for Serial on Zero based boards
			  #define Serial SERIAL_PORT_USBVIRTUAL
			#endif
		
		2) If you want to track ram availability:
		
			extern "C" char *sbrk(int i);
			
			int FreeRam () {
			  char stack_dummy = 0;
			  return &stack_dummy - sbrk(0);
			}

Adafruit 10-DOF IMU Breakout Setup:
	
	1) install libraries from github as zip files: "Clone or download" > Download ZIP

SD Card on Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger:

	See: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger/using-the-sd-card
	Provides a great description of what goes on.
	
	Copy the code in the provided examples to try writing out to the SD card.
	
	Notes:
		1) Make sure you have an SD card inserted in the Feather M0 or you it will return errors.
		2) You may need to create a log file manually. Simply insert the SD card into your 
			computer (may need a USB adapter) and create a new text file with the same name as set
			in your code. "ANALOG00.TXT" if you are using the example code from the Adafruit website.
